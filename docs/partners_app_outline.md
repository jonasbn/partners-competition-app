I want to build an leader board app for the game of "partners" that will include the following:

* display a leader board of players based on their cumulative score
* display a list of games and their outcomes and scores by the various players
* a game consist of 3 participating teams
* each team will have a score
* a first place i 3 points
* a second place is 2 points
* a third place is 1 point
* each game will have a date and time
* each game will have an unique id
* each player will have a name
* There are 6 players in total
* the players are named:
  * Jonas
  * Torben
  * Gitte
  * Anette
  * Lotte
  * Peter
* each player will have a score per game
* each player will have a cumulative score
* each player will have a unique id
* a team consist of two players
* each player can play in multiple games
* each player are participating in a team per game
* The data should be stored in a JSON file

* Existing games are available in the JSON file: `games.json`
* The JSON is just for data
* A new JSON structure should be created to store the leaderboard and game outcomes

It should be in one app

generate instructions in this order

1. Outline the JSON structure for the data 
2. Create the frontend based on react and bootstrap
3. Setup the partners-app/frontend directory will store the react app with no subdirectories
4. Install react framework
5. Install bootstrap and import it
6. Start the react app and ensure it runs correctly

Use bootstrap for the frontend

Let's think about this step by step
