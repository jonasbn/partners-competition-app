# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: White Page with "can't access property 'Activity', et is undefined" Error

### Problem Summary

The deployed application at <https://partners-competition-app-4pt8z.ondigitalocean.app/> was showing a white page with a JavaScript error related to @nivo chart library imports.

### Root Cause

The error was likely caused by:

1. ES module import/export compatibility issues between @nivo libraries and the production build
2. Missing error boundaries around chart components
3. Potential race conditions in lazy-loaded chart components

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Dynamic Import Strategy

- Created `RobustCalendarChart` component with async dynamic imports
- Implemented proper loading states and error handling
- Components now handle ES module compatibility issues gracefully

#### 2. Enhanced Error Boundaries

- Added `ChartErrorBoundary` component to catch chart-specific errors
- Wrapped all lazy-loaded chart components with error boundaries
- Multiple layers of error handling for maximum resilience

#### 3. Graceful Degradation

- Charts show loading spinners while components load
- Fallback to informative messages when charts can't load
- Users can still access all other app functionality even if charts fail
- Error messages provide context and alternative data access

#### 4. Build Optimizations

- Maintained chunk splitting strategy for better caching
- Dynamic imports resolve ES module compatibility issues
- Verified build process completes without critical errors

### Files Modified

- `src/components/ChartErrorBoundary.jsx` (new error boundary component)
- `src/components/RobustCalendarChart.jsx` (new robust calendar with dynamic imports)
- `src/components/SimpleCalendarChart.jsx` (simple fallback component)
- `src/components/SimpleRadarChart.jsx` (simple fallback component)
- `src/components/LazyCharts.jsx` (enhanced with error boundaries and robust components)
- `src/components/GamesCalendarChart.jsx` (original with try-catch handling)
- `src/components/PlayerStrengthChart.jsx` (original with try-catch handling)

### Testing

- ✅ Build completes successfully without errors
- ✅ All 67 tests pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ Local preview works correctly
- ✅ Chart components degrade gracefully on error

### Deployment Checklist

1. **Build Verification**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
2. **Local Testing**: Test with `npm run preview` before deployment
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. **Error Monitoring**: Check browser console for runtime errors
5. **Fallback Content**: Verify error messages display correctly when charts fail

### Monitoring

The application now includes:

- Runtime error logging for chart components
- Graceful fallback UI when components fail
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting hints
- "Try Again" buttons for error recovery

### Future Improvements

1. Add service worker for better offline experience
2. Implement retry logic for failed chart loads
3. Add performance monitoring for chart render times
4. Consider progressive enhancement for chart features

### If Issues Persist

1. Check browser developer console for specific error messages
2. Verify all static assets are being served correctly
3. Test with disabled JavaScript to ensure basic HTML structure loads
4. Check network tab for failed resource requests
5. Consider rollback to previous working version if critical

### Emergency Rollback

If the current deployment fails:

```bash
# Build previous stable version
git checkout <previous-stable-commit>
npm install
npm run build
# Deploy the build/ directory
```

For deployment issues, check:

- Build logs on DigitalOcean App Platform
- Browser developer console errors
- Network connectivity to static assets
